# Problem log (agent-maintained)

This file is a **shared memory** of errors fixed and problems identified in this repo. Agents should **search here first** (repo search or open this file) when symptoms look familiar.

## How agents update this file

1. **When:** After you fix a failing build, test, linter error, runtime error, or incorrect behavior; or after you identify a non-obvious root cause worth remembering.
2. **Where:** Prepend a new `##` section **immediately below** the `<!-- ENTRIES_START -->` marker (newest entries at the top).
3. **Keep it short:** A few lines per field is enough.

## 2026-04-23 — Production UI “backend unreachable” while Railway backend is healthy

- **Symptom:** Hosted frontend on Railway stayed on loading then showed disconnected / “Backend unreachable”; `curl` to the backend `/api/health` and `/api/gappers` returned 200. Downloaded production `assets/index-*.js` still contained `localhost` / `:8000`, not the Railway backend hostname.
- **Cause:** `VITE_*` variables are inlined at **Vite build time**. Setting `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in the Railway dashboard without a **new** frontend build left the old bundle. Optional: GitHub Actions was configured for `main` only while the repo default branch is `master`, so “wait for CI” could block or never align with pushes.
- **Fix:** Documented behavior via a `prebuild` script that exits non-zero on Railway when `VITE_API_BASE_URL` is unset. Extended `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` to `main` and `master` (including the deploy job condition). Operators must **Redeploy** the Frontend service after setting or changing the variable.

## 2026-04-16 — Railway Railpack “could not determine how to build” on monorepo root

- **Symptom:** Railway build failed with Railpack: `Script start.sh not found`, `Railpack could not determine how to build the app`, and the analyzed tree showed the full repo (`.cursor/`, `backend/`, `frontend/`, etc.) with no Python at the service root.
- **Cause:** Default builder Railpack only inspects the configured build root. With **Root Directory** left at the repo root, there is no `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` at `./` (Python lives under `backend/`). The old `backend/railway.toml` alone is not applied unless the service points “Config as code” at `/backend/railway.toml`, and `builder = "nixpacks"` is ignored when the platform defaults to Railpack.
- **Fix:** Added a **root `railway.toml`** that sets `builder = "DOCKERFILE"` and `dockerfilePath = "Dockerfile"`, plus a **root `Dockerfile`** that `COPY backend/` and runs uvicorn on `$PORT`. Added **`backend/Dockerfile`** and switched **`backend/railway.toml`** to the same Docker builder for deployments where Root Directory is `backend`. Added **`.dockerignore`** to shrink build context.

## 2026-04-16 — Volume frozen in scanner lists and ticker detail panel despite continuous data loading

- **Symptom:** Volume column in gapper/mover tables never updated while price changed in real time. Ticker detail panel "Volume" field also stuck at the value fetched on initial load. Zero-volume tickers showed `—` instead of `0`.
- **Cause:** (1) `_handle_trade()` only read `S` (symbol) and `p` (price) from the Alpaca trade WS message, discarding `s` (trade size). (2) `_broadcast_trade_update()` payload had no volume field, so ticker-detail WS clients never received updated volume. (3) `fmtVolume()` used `if (!v)` which treats `0` as falsy.
- **Fix:** `_handle_trade` now extracts `size = int(msg.get("s") or 0)` and adds it to the `volume` field of every updated cache entry (gapper, after-hours, gainer, loser). `_apply_trade_to_mover_list` accepts a `size` param and accumulates it. `_handle_trade` returns the new cumulative volume. `_ws_stream_loop` passes that to `_broadcast_trade_update`, which now includes `volume` in its JSON payload. Frontend `TickerTradeUpdate` interface gains `volume: number | null`; the `trade_update` handler updates `daily_bar.volume` and recomputes `rel_volume` accordingly. `fmtVolume` changed to `if (v == null)`. Drift from WS gaps self-heals via the existing periodic `_fetch_snapshots` scan loop.

## 2026-04-16 — Gapper gap % wrong during pre-market (using day-before-yesterday close)

- **Symptom:** Pre-market gapper table showed inflated gap percentages (e.g., BIRD +432% instead of -22%). Stocks with a large yesterday move appeared as massive gappers even if they were gapping DOWN in pre-market. Stock quote panel also showed wrong change % vs previous close.
- **Cause:** Alpaca snapshot `prevDailyBar` semantics differ by session. During pre-market (before 9:30 ET), `dailyBar` = yesterday's completed regular session bar, and `prevDailyBar` = the session before that (two days ago). The code always used `prevDailyBar.c` as "previous close" regardless of session, so during pre-market it computed gap vs the wrong reference (two days ago vs yesterday).
- **Fix:** Added `_pick_prev_close(snap)` helper in `backend/main.py` that inspects `dailyBar.t` (the bar timestamp). If the bar's date in ET is before today, `dailyBar` is yesterday's close and is returned. Otherwise returns `prevDailyBar.c`. Updated `_compute_gappers()` and `_run_focus_scan()` to use this helper. Updated `_fetch_ticker_snapshot()` to expose `prev_close`, `session_close`, `session_prev_close` fields. Frontend `TickerDetailContent` now uses `snap.prev_close` and shows a Webull-style two-line quote (main line = last regular-session close, sub-line = Pre:/After: with extended-hours price and change vs session close) during pre-market/after-hours.
- **Keywords:** gapper, prev close, prevDailyBar, dailyBar, pre-market, gap percent, Alpaca snapshot, bar timestamp, session close, two-line quote, pre-market quote

## 2026-04-15 — Quote side panel flashes empty / “screen disappears” on ticker click

- **Symptom:** Clicking a scanner row to open a quote briefly blanked the side panel or showed “No data found” before the spinner or quote appeared.
- **Cause:** After `selectedSymbol` updates, React renders **once before** the WebSocket `useEffect` runs. In that frame `loading` and `refreshing` were still false and `detail` was null, so the UI matched the **empty-state** branch (`!loading && !refreshing && !detail && selectedSymbol`). Runtime logs (`panel_branch` with `showEmpty: true` then `showSpinner: true`) confirmed the ordering.
- **Fix:** Treat that pre-effect gap as loading: `awaitingPreEffectFrame = selectedSymbol && !detail && !loading && !refreshing && !fetchFailed`, and `showFullSpinner = loading || awaitingPreEffectFrame`. Show “No data found” only when `fetchFailed` is set after a real WS close/error without an `initial` message (not StrictMode cleanup).

## 2026-04-15 — After-hours tab: strong ticker missing despite large move (e.g. MAMO)

- **Symptom:** A symbol looked like a clear after-hours mover (large % change, volume) but never appeared on the After Hours list / tab count stayed low; manual Alpaca snapshot showed a large move vs `dailyBar.c`.
- **Cause:** The gap math and 10% threshold were fine. Alpaca’s `/v2/assets/{symbol}` can return **`tradable: false`** for an otherwise active listing (e.g. `overnight_halted` while another mover like AREB stays `tradable: true`). The scanner only requested snapshots for symbols passing **`tradable`** in `_get_tradable_symbols`, so those names were never scanned.
- **Fix:** Added `SCAN_REQUIRE_TRADABLE` (default `True`) and env **`BLAST_SCAN_REQUIRE_TRADABLE`** (`true`/`false`) so operators can include non-tradable active listings when needed; documented in `constants.py`.
- **Keywords:** after hours, MAMO, tradable false, Alpaca assets, scan universe, overnight_halted, BLAST_SCAN_REQUIRE_TRADABLE

## 2026-04-15 — Alpaca WS “connection limit exceeded” (406) and stale live prices

- **Symptom:** Scanner UI did not update second-by-second; backend log showed repeated `Alpaca WS auth failed` with `code: 406`, `msg: 'connection limit exceeded'`. Sometimes two “connecting” lines appeared close together in `blast.log`.
- **Cause:** `uvicorn --reload` without the `watchfiles` package falls back to **StatReload**, which ignores `--reload-exclude`. The rotating log (`backend/logs/blast.log`) and disk cache (`backend/.cache/`) changed frequently; each change restarted the worker. Overlapping processes each tried to open Alpaca’s market-data WebSocket; Alpaca allows **one** concurrent WS per API key, so new workers got 406 until slots cleared. Multiple long-lived terminals could also leave several backends running at once, making the limit worse.
- **Fix:** Add `watchfiles` to `backend/requirements.txt` so reload exclusions apply; pass `--reload-exclude logs --reload-exclude .cache` in `Run Stock Alert.bat`; keep `ALPACA_WS_BACKOFF_CAP` at 60s to avoid hammering reconnects. When debugging, kill **all** `python3.13` / uvicorn workers (not only `py.exe`) and avoid running several API instances in parallel.
- **Keywords:** Alpaca, WebSocket, 406, connection limit exceeded, uvicorn reload, StatReload, watchfiles, reload-exclude, blast.log, .cache, gappers.json, live data, stale
