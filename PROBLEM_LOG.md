# Problem log (agent-maintained)

This file is a **shared memory** of errors fixed and problems identified in this repo. Agents should **search here first** (repo search or open this file) when symptoms look familiar.

## How agents update this file

1. **When:** After you fix a failing build, test, linter error, runtime error, or incorrect behavior; or after you identify a non-obvious root cause worth remembering.
2. **Where:** Prepend a new `##` section **immediately below** the `<!-- ENTRIES_START -->` marker (newest entries at the top).
3. **Keep it short:** A few lines per field is enough.

Entry template (copy and fill in):

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD — Short descriptive title

- **Symptom:** What failed or misbehaved (error text, stack trace one-liner, or user-visible behavior).
- **Cause:** Root cause in plain language.
- **Fix:** What changed (conceptually; file paths if helpful).
- **Keywords:** comma, separated, terms, for, search

## 2026-04-15 — Alpaca WS “connection limit exceeded” (406) and stale live prices

- **Symptom:** Scanner UI did not update second-by-second; backend log showed repeated `Alpaca WS auth failed` with `code: 406`, `msg: 'connection limit exceeded'`. Sometimes two “connecting” lines appeared close together in `blast.log`.
- **Cause:** `uvicorn --reload` without the `watchfiles` package falls back to **StatReload**, which ignores `--reload-exclude`. The rotating log (`backend/logs/blast.log`) and disk cache (`backend/.cache/`) changed frequently; each change restarted the worker. Overlapping processes each tried to open Alpaca’s market-data WebSocket; Alpaca allows **one** concurrent WS per API key, so new workers got 406 until slots cleared. Multiple long-lived terminals could also leave several backends running at once, making the limit worse.
- **Fix:** Add `watchfiles` to `backend/requirements.txt` so reload exclusions apply; pass `--reload-exclude logs --reload-exclude .cache` in `Run Stock Alert.bat`; keep `ALPACA_WS_BACKOFF_CAP` at 60s to avoid hammering reconnects. When debugging, kill **all** `python3.13` / uvicorn workers (not only `py.exe`) and avoid running several API instances in parallel.
- **Keywords:** Alpaca, WebSocket, 406, connection limit exceeded, uvicorn reload, StatReload, watchfiles, reload-exclude, blast.log, .cache, gappers.json, live data, stale
